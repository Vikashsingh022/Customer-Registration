## Overview
This project is a modern, animated customer registration form for use by sales executives during field visits or customer onboarding.

- Google Maps preview for captured location
- Device/browser info captured on registration
- All fields validated (including age >= 15 years)
- Animated input focus/blur and button effects
- Success confirmation screen

## Tech Stack

cd server
npm install
npm start
```
- The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- Make sure to update `server/index.js` with your MySQL credentials if needed.

### 4. Frontend Setup
